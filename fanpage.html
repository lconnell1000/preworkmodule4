        <H2>Bio</H2>

        <p>
            <br>At 28 years of age, Will Sparks is not your average high school drop. He dropped out of school in year 11
            to pursue a music career and hasn't looked back since. His debut EP, "Another Land", was released in Australia
            and debuted at number 35 in December 2014. He was named the No.1 Australian DJ in 2014.
            <br>
            <br>Since his genre-defining track, ‘Ah Yeah!’ hit #3 on the Beatport overall charts at the tail end of 2012, Will 
            Sparks has been unstoppable, curating a catalogue of highly esteemed, energising repertoire by producing hit after 
            hit and gaining recognition from a number of dance music heavyweights and the biggest names in the industry and 
            winning him multiple Gold and Platinum records to decorate the walls with, including FOUR top 10  Beatport records 
            before May, 2017 alone. His SoundCloud page stands as testament to his phenomenal influence as a producer, racking 
            up millions of plays on a single release alone and his countless original productions have spent weeks inside the 
            Beatport top 10 in addition to signature remixes of global hits such as Major Lazer’s ‘Be Together’, Robin Thicke’s 
            ‘Blurred Lines’, The Chainsmokers’ ‘Selfie’ and a sync deal that saw his hit track ‘Ah Yeah’ featured as the main 
            promotional track for hit US TV series ‘Ballers’ with The Rock.
            <br>
            <br>To add to his impressive resume, Will Sparks has curated his own record label ‘Bourne Recordings – a joint venture 
            with Lucky Ent and Ministry of Sound Australia, which has a mission of supporting young talent and emerging artists 
            as well as acting as a home for his releases. Bourne now boasts multiple Beatport overall Top 10’s.
            <br>
            <br>With a social reach in the millions, and the ability to adapt to an ever-changing musical landscape whilst still 
            holding the signature Will Sparks brand and sound, there is no doubt Will Sparks is an artist that is here for the long run.
